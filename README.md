# Skin Cancer Detection Case Study
> The project is about building a multiclass classification model using a custom convolutional neural network in TensorFlow. 


## General Information
The objective of this work is to build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, which were formed from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC). All images were sorted according to the classification taken with ISIC.

The data set contains the following diseases:

- Actinic keratosis
- Basal cell carcinoma
- Dermatofibroma
- Melanoma
- Nevus
- Pigmented benign keratosis
- Seborrheic keratosis
- Squamous cell carcinoma
- Vascular lesion

## Technologies Used
- Keras 
- Tensorflow
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Augmentor

## Conclusions
Three custom CNN models were built and the final model performed better both in terms of accuracy and loss.
 
The result of the third model:
